# example_flutter_method_channel

A mapbox SDK in kotlin running inside a flutter app.

## Getting Started

You have to change the mapbox token in 6 places, search for "YOU-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE" without double quotes, and replace with the token given by me.

the bug is that navigation of map doesn`t start sometimes. You need to unfocus and focus again the app so the navigation starts.

the task is to solve this bug, and make the map embedded in a flutter widget, like container.
